# SurfsUp

Overview of the statistical analysis: The purpose of the analysis is well defined.

W. Avy wants to become an entrepreneur by likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
About temperature, he specifically wants to know the precipitation, since the rainy days can persuade the performance of the business overall.

Results: There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.
June
The following chart of list indicates the average temperature of each day of the month of June.
With this list we can have a quick look of how´s the rain´s behavior over the days. We can observe the days where temperature drops a bit indicating that that day might have rained.

Now, for most important we have the summary.
In the summary we can actually see more information of the temperature.
In average the temperature was 74 degrees, and it actually quite moved a lot taking out an outlier of 64 degrees. This indicates us that the temperature in there was actually pretty steady.

December
In this list for December we can observe what we expected, the temperature for each day are lower.
Since they are lower we can´t infer that a low temperature day might be because of rain, like in June.

list_dec
Now, also the summary has a diffference of course. But as a big surprise, for some data the difference gap isn´t big.
We´ll see the comparisons in the next bullets. Sum_dec

Differences
The averages have a difference of 4 degrees. For June is 75 and for Dec 71.
As this data is from Hawaii is not a big surprise that the max temperatures for both months are quite similar. For June is 85 and for December 83!
There´s a big difference in mean temperature. It´s a difference 10 degrees!
Summary: There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
W.Avy´s concern was getting the business ruined by the rain. If we comparer the 2 motnhs weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation in average are close. The temperature data is not different from each other. The ratio of the temperatures to the temperature for the two months is close with few outliers.
Overall we are happy to anounce W.Avy that after analyzing, and studying the data we have our final statement:
The data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round!
